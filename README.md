## About me
Hi, my name is **Aminu Abdulrasheed**, a **Computer Science graduate** from **Federal University Lokoja** with a strong passion for **data analytics and data science**. I thrive on transforming raw data into meaningful insights that drive informed decision-making.  

With a solid foundation in data management, statistical analysis, and business intelligence, I have developed expertise in **SQL, Python, Excel, and visualization tools like Power BI and Tableau**. My ability to identify trends, clean and process complex datasets, and derive actionable insights makes me a valuable asset for data-driven roles.  

Beyond technical skills, I bring problem-solving abilities, attention to detail, and a leadership mindset gained through community leadership and collaborative projects. I am eager to apply these skills in an entry-level data analyst role, where I can contribute to impactful decision-making and continue expanding my expertise in machine learning, automation, and data-driven strategies.  

This repository serves as a showcase of my data analytics projects, skills, and progress  in mastering data science methodologies. Feel free to explore my work, and letâ€™s connect!
