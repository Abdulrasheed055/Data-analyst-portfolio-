## About
Hi, my name Aminu Abdulrasheed computer science graduate of federal university lokoja , I have developed a strong foundation in the computer sciences and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data analyst and data sciece as an entry-level data specialist

During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in  communities leadership, data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data analyst.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problem

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.
